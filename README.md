Hi, I'm [Neel Patel](https://neelpatel1998.github.io/), a passionate self-taught individual interested in data science and software development fields. I have completed my bachelors in India and currently pursuing my masters at University of Windsor at Canada. My passion lies in learning new things, dreaming up ideas and making them come true. I take great care in the experience, code quality of the things I build.

I am looking for Co-op and Internsip opportunities for Winter 2022. I like working in the fields of Data, Artificial Intelligence and Software Development. I have knowledge of cloud platforms and services they offer. I love to learn new things from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge is shared in current generation through open-source platforms.
